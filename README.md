# 3D Reconstruction of one room
This repository contains the codebase of web application, which uses the *3D reconstruction* model (DUSt3R) for rendering indoor scenes. Since DUSt3R performs *3D reconstruction* of 2D images without camera parameters, an indoor 3D reconstruction application was developed with only image information crawled from the web.  
For more information on DUSt3R, please check the address[https://github.com/naver/dust3r].
